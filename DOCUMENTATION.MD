| GET  	| /api/plate-numbers  	| api_token=  	| Returns all the plate numbers generated by the user. |

After registration the ``UNIQUE API TOKEN STRING`` found in the api_token column in the users table 
can be used to retrieve all plate numbers that has been generated by that users via ``REST API``. 
Since they is no provision for authentication via ``REST API`` the token has to be manually copied from the database.

``POSTMAN`` can be used for this and sample request URI will look like this 
``http://{your-domain}/api/plate-numbers?api_token='api 
token string'``
